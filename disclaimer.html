                        <h3>⚠️ Important Legal Warning</h3>
                        <p><strong>THIS WEBSITE DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>1. No Medical Advice</h3>
                    <p>The information, content, and tools provided on GLP-1 Lifestyle Companion (including but not
                        limited to text, graphics, images, calculators, and other material) are for <strong>educational
                            and informational purposes only</strong>.</p>
                    <p>No material on this site is intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice,
                        diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health
                        provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition, medication, or treatment
                        plan.</p>

                    <h3>2. Consult Your Clinician</h3>
                    <p>Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have
                        read on this website. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or
                        emergency services immediately.</p>
                    <p>GLP-1 medications (such as Ozempic®, Wegovy®, Mounjaro®, Zepbound™) are serious prescriptions
                        that require medical supervision. Dosing, side effect management, and dietary changes should
                        always be discussed with your prescribing clinician.</p>

                    <h3>3. Accuracy of Information</h3>
                    <p>While we strive to provide accurate, evidence-based lifestyle information, medical knowledge
                        changes quickly. We cannot guarantee that all information on this site is completely current,
                        accurate, or complete. Reliance on any information provided by this website is solely at your
                        own risk.</p>

                    <h3>4. No Patient-Provider Relationship</h3>
                    <p>Use of this website does not establish a doctor-patient relationship. Communications with us or
                        use of our tools does not constitute medical care.</p>
